Rubric
- Please submit your report in PDF format. Submit code in an additional file containing sufficient
comments to make it understandable.
- Analyze all of the three data sets that have been provided to you in the
assignment.
- Some general questions to answer:
  - What is the trend in different areas (states, counties) of the US?
  - Is social distancing done and is it working?
  - Can we identify regions that do particularly well?
  - Can we predict the development in a region given the data of other regions?

Business Understanding (10 Points)
- What is COVID-19 and what is social distancing and flattening the curve?
- Why is it important to look at data about the virus spread, hospitalizations, and available resources?
- Who is interested in this information?
- What decisions can be informed using such data?

Data Understanding (45 Points)
- What data is available? Describe the type of data (scale, values, etc.) of the most important variables in the data. (9 Points)
- erify data quality: Are there missing values? Duplicate Data? Outliers? Are those mistakes? How can these be fixed? (9 Points)
- Give simple appropriate statistics (range, mode, mean, median, variance, etc.) for the most important variables in these files and describe what they mean or if you find
something interesting. (9 points)
- Visualize the most important attributes appropriately. Provide an interpretation for each graph. Explain for each attribute type why you chose the visualization. (9 points)
- Explore relationships between attributes: Look at the attributes and then use cross-tabulation, correlation, group-wise averages, and box plots, etc. as appropriate. (9 points)

Data Preparation (45 Points)
- Create a data set with objects as rows and features as columns. Use as objects counties in the US. The data set must be included in your report. Provide a table in word that
shows the data (values) for the first 10 rows for all the features you have selected and/or created. Interesting additional features may be for example: (30 points)
  - When was the first case reported?
  - How (densely) populated is the county?
  - What resources does a county have (money, hospital)?
  - What is the social distancing response and how long did it take after the first case?
- Visualize the created attributes. (15 points)

Exceptional Work (10 Points)
- Developing special preprocessing and explaining your approach/method in detail with examples   "OR"
- Using an additional data set beyond the three provided. You must analyze the additional data set in the same way you analyzed all the three data sets
provided. This means that you must apply the steps provided in Data Understanding to the additional data set.
