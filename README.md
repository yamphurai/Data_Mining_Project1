Structure
	•	Organize the report using CRISP-DM. Use this Word Project template Download Project template . You can also use an R Markdown document. 
	•	Pages need to be numbered.
	•	The document needs to end with a conclusion that summarizes the main findings and a list of recommendations.
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Business Understanding
	•	Who are the main actors in the field? What do they want/need?
	•	Can you get some numbers from other reports or studies?
	•	What is published about the topic in the news/in academic publications? Do at least an internet search.
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Tables
	•	Do not use screenshots or copy raw R output. Format the data as Word tables.  Highlight important information.
	•	You can copy the tables from the HTML version of your R notebook.
	•	Tables need to be numbered and referenced in the text. Discuss what we can learn from the numbers in the table.
	•	Use a table to describe features in a consistent and easy-to-read way.

Figures
	•	You can copy&paste figures from the HTML version of your R notebook.
	•	Every figure/plot must have a caption with a number under it (for example, "Figure 1: The impact of …"). It needs to be referenced (by number) and discussed in the text. What do we see, and how is it helpful? Figures without a discussion are useless.
	•	If there are several options to plot the same thing, choose the best visualization. You may highlight essential aspects in the graph.
	•	Your graph needs proper names for both axes (use xlab and ylab in the plot).
	•	Ensure your graphs are readable (text/numbers in graphs should be about the same size as the regular text in your document). Graphs should be pretty (add a legend, use color where appropriate, etc). However, figures should not waste space!
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Code
	•	Upload the code as a separate R or Rmd file. The code needs to be executable as is and contain comments.
	•	Short pieces of code can be included in the Appendix of the main document if they are particularly interesting.
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Experiments
	•	Use an appropriate way to organize your experiments (e.g., different classification algorithms) and present results. You need some reasoning as to why you chose the experiments you did and did not do others.
	•	It is essential to compare the results from different experiments. What worked best and why?
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
References
	•	Add as many references (books, papers, URLs) as possible so others know where the information you use comes from. State the sources of code, tools, or additional data used. The aim is to make your work reproducible by someone who reads the report.
	•	You may use footnotes or any consistent reference style (ACM, IEEE, Named, etc.).
